    "description": "Now a famous Italian coffee, cappuccino is an espresso-based java that comes from an Austrian drink called kapuziner (via Super Coffee). Inspired by the dark color of robes worn by Kapuzin friars of Austria in the 1700s, kapuziner was made with coffee, milk, sugar, and a swirl of whipped cream on top. What we now know as cappuccino, Perfect Daily Grind explains, was concocted by Italians in the 1900s for whom cappuccino was the ideal morning coffee that could be drunk in a handful of gulps for a quick jolt of caffeine.\n\nWhile the exact method to making a cappuccino differs between leading coffee institutions of the world, Super Coffee writes that a 1:1:1 ratio of espresso, steamed milk, and foamed milk is generally followed in the U.S. That is, a cappuccino is usually one-third espresso and one-third steamed milk, followed by one-third of creamy milk foam on top. Per Daily Perfect Grind, when brewed by a skilled barista, the steamed milk and milk foam will form layers over the espresso instead of blending into it. The layers are the biggest giveaway that visibly distinguishes a cappuccino from other milk-based espresso coffees. This is also why a cappuccino usually tastes more intense than its milky counterparts and highlights the flavor of the coffee beans much better whilst giving a creamier mouthfeel."

    "description": "The origin of this espresso-based coffee can be traced back to Spain's Basque County, where cortado was given its name after the Spanish verb cortar, meaning to cut (per Perfect Daily Grind). A smaller version of a cappuccino, Roasty Coffee says that a cortado has just enough milk \"to cut\" the espresso and its acidity.\n\nEqual parts of milk and espresso are used to brew a cortado. As Roasty Coffee reports, the milk, although steamed, has little to no foam. While the lack of froth means that cortado isn't as creamy as other coffees that use foamed milk, it also means that the steamed milk will blend smoothly into the espresso without forming layers. According to Bon Appétit. This makes cortado a very balanced coffee, only a small amount of milk allows the flavors of the espresso to shine without being too intense or milky.\n\nTraditionally, you will find a cortado served in a small metal or glass tumbler and it usually lacks any latte art on top. While most coffees come in different sizes, a cortado is a drink that is meant to be small, and so is almost always served in one standard size even at famous coffee chains."

    "description": "Although cappuccino has Austrian roots, sources are clear that Italians popularized the foamy drink in the 1900s. Latte, on the other hand (though Italian in origin) was not meant for Italians to drink at all! According to Coffee Bros., the caffè latte was invented in 1867 for American tourists in Italy for whom the Italian cappuccino was too strong a coffee. Consequently, the latte was fashioned to be a less intense and considerably more milky version of a cappuccino for not-so-strong coffee-loving Americans.\n\nTypically, a latte is served in a glass as opposed to a mug and contains mainly espresso and steamed milk with only a thin layer of foam on top, per Coffee Bros. Because of the high quantity of milk — which is more significant than most espresso-based drinks — a latte tends to mask the flavor of the espresso well, making it a solid option for anybody who doesn't much care about the flavor of coffee and only wants it for its caffeine kick. Furthermore, Coffee Bros. writes that the milky taste of a latte, which has only a mild hint of espresso, also explains why lattes are perhaps more popular than any other hot coffee when adding all sorts of syrups and flavors."

    "description": "If the name doesn't already give it away, the red eye coffee is named after a red-eye flight that flies across countries through the night and often leaves travelers with red eyes from exhaustion (via Trade). Unsurprisingly, the red eye is a very, very strong drink. Unlike most other coffees that blend the source of caffeine with water, milk, or other non-caffeinated mix-ins, the red eye combines coffee with ... more coffee. \n\nOriginally a secret menu item at Starbucks, Trade writes that red eye coffees can now be found everywhere. The drink is essentially just a cup of regular drip coffee but with the addition of a shot of espresso on top. The taste of a red eye coffee is often compared to an Americano, except it has more body. Although the coffee is intense, Trade finds that the sweet flavor of drip coffee works well with bitter espresso.\n\nWhile the red eye usually adds one shot of espresso to drip coffee, A Couple Cooks notes that stronger versions of this already-strong coffee exist too. A black eye uses two espresso shots with its drip coffee, whereas a green eye or dead eye uses three. If there was ever a coffee to help pull through an especially sluggish day or a long all-nighter, something stronger than a red eye is going to be hard to find."

    "description": "For a long time, mocha or moka referred to a type of Arabica coffee bean grown in Yemen and was used as a blanket term for coffee beans imported from Yemen's port of Al Moka — the place after which the bean was named (via Coffee Or Die). The mocha beans were famous for having a green and yellow tint compared to their brown-colored counterparts. The mocha's iconic association with chocolate also begins here, as the beans were thought to have a distinct, chocolate-like flavor, writes Coffee Or Die.\n\nThe modern mocha as we know it today comes from a drink called bicerin, which was popular in 18th century Italy. According to Sprudge, the drink was called after an Italian coffee house by the name of Caffè al Bicerin, which served its customers a beverage of coffee, cream, and chocolate. At the time, Caffè al Bicerin served the three ingredients separately to the café's patrons, who could then mix them as per their taste, per Sprudge.\n\nEven today, mocha is made from similar layers of espresso, milk, and chocolate. The chocolate can be dark, milk, or white and can be added in various forms, including chocolate powder, syrup, and even just melted chocolate (via Super Coffee). Sometimes, a single mocha can even have multiple sources of chocolate! Although the exact method in which a mocha is prepared differs between baristas — whether they add milk froth or not, the kind of chocolate that is used, and how the three ingredients are mixed — one thing remains the same: the luscious mix of milk, chocolate, and coffee!"

    "description": "For a long time, mocha or moka referred to a type of Arabica coffee bean grown in Yemen and was used as a blanket term for coffee beans imported from Yemen's port of Al Moka — the place after which the bean was named (via Coffee Or Die). The mocha beans were famous for having a green and yellow tint compared to their brown-colored counterparts. The mocha's iconic association with chocolate also begins here, as the beans were thought to have a distinct, chocolate-like flavor, writes Coffee Or Die.\n\nThe modern mocha as we know it today comes from a drink called bicerin, which was popular in 18th century Italy. According to Sprudge, the drink was called after an Italian coffee house by the name of Caffè al Bicerin, which served its customers a beverage of coffee, cream, and chocolate. At the time, Caffè al Bicerin served the three ingredients separately to the café's patrons, who could then mix them as per their taste, per Sprudge.\n\nEven today, mocha is made from similar layers of espresso, milk, and chocolate. The chocolate can be dark, milk, or white and can be added in various forms, including chocolate powder, syrup, and even just melted chocolate (via Super Coffee). Sometimes, a single mocha can even have multiple sources of chocolate! Although the exact method in which a mocha is prepared differs between baristas — whether they add milk froth or not, the kind of chocolate that is used, and how the three ingredients are mixed — one thing remains the same: the luscious mix of milk, chocolate, and coffee!"

    "description": "Now a famous Italian coffee, cappuccino is an espresso-based java that comes from an Austrian drink called kapuziner (via Super Coffee). Inspired by the dark color of robes worn by Kapuzin friars of Austria in the 1700s, kapuziner was made with coffee, milk, sugar, and a swirl of whipped cream on top. What we now know as cappuccino, Perfect Daily Grind explains, was concocted by Italians in the 1900s for whom cappuccino was the ideal morning coffee that could be drunk in a handful of gulps for a quick jolt of caffeine.\n\nWhile the exact method to making a cappuccino differs between leading coffee institutions of the world, Super Coffee writes that a 1:1:1 ratio of espresso, steamed milk, and foamed milk is generally followed in the U.S. That is, a cappuccino is usually one-third espresso and one-third steamed milk, followed by one-third of creamy milk foam on top. Per Daily Perfect Grind, when brewed by a skilled barista, the steamed milk and milk foam will form layers over the espresso instead of blending into it. The layers are the biggest giveaway that visibly distinguishes a cappuccino from other milk-based espresso coffees. This is also why a cappuccino usually tastes more intense than its milky counterparts and highlights the flavor of the coffee beans much better whilst giving a creamier mouthfeel."

    "description": "The origin of this espresso-based coffee can be traced back to Spain's Basque County, where cortado was given its name after the Spanish verb cortar, meaning to cut (per Perfect Daily Grind). A smaller version of a cappuccino, Roasty Coffee says that a cortado has just enough milk \"to cut\" the espresso and its acidity.\n\nEqual parts of milk and espresso are used to brew a cortado. As Roasty Coffee reports, the milk, although steamed, has little to no foam. While the lack of froth means that cortado isn't as creamy as other coffees that use foamed milk, it also means that the steamed milk will blend smoothly into the espresso without forming layers. According to Bon Appétit. This makes cortado a very balanced coffee, only a small amount of milk allows the flavors of the espresso to shine without being too intense or milky.\n\nTraditionally, you will find a cortado served in a small metal or glass tumbler and it usually lacks any latte art on top. While most coffees come in different sizes, a cortado is a drink that is meant to be small, and so is almost always served in one standard size even at famous coffee chains."

    "description": "Although cappuccino has Austrian roots, sources are clear that Italians popularized the foamy drink in the 1900s. Latte, on the other hand (though Italian in origin) was not meant for Italians to drink at all! According to Coffee Bros., the caffè latte was invented in 1867 for American tourists in Italy for whom the Italian cappuccino was too strong a coffee. Consequently, the latte was fashioned to be a less intense and considerably more milky version of a cappuccino for not-so-strong coffee-loving Americans.\n\nTypically, a latte is served in a glass as opposed to a mug and contains mainly espresso and steamed milk with only a thin layer of foam on top, per Coffee Bros. Because of the high quantity of milk — which is more significant than most espresso-based drinks — a latte tends to mask the flavor of the espresso well, making it a solid option for anybody who doesn't much care about the flavor of coffee and only wants it for its caffeine kick. Furthermore, Coffee Bros. writes that the milky taste of a latte, which has only a mild hint of espresso, also explains why lattes are perhaps more popular than any other hot coffee when adding all sorts of syrups and flavors."
